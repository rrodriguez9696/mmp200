          <p>Space Magic. My goal with this asssingment was to turn each element such as ellispse in order to make a UFO that would travel across the page and reset when it hits the end of the page. I did this by turning it into it into a function and by giving it a variableto identify the object and the speed it would move in.I also added a random factor to it whuch would change the color of the f the background and and UFO LED lights. </p>

          <p>This project is very simple but abstract. I used ellsipse and but them in a ForLoop in order to make it match the width and the height of the page.While also adding a random effect of the size and color of eavh ball. </p>

          <p>  The Winter Event. I wanted to make this my theme since becasue like many people including myself, enjoy this time of the year and becuase i figure i could use my love for games and incoprated in this project. The break the, the gifts, and spending time with family and friends! Now, with this project i had many heardles. I took the advice of not playing it safe snd try to really changelle myself. My intial project was to make mario (not use an img, literally make him) and make him jump to put the star on top of tree. Sounds alot easier said than done. One of the many changelles I had was making a realistic "Santa mario". All though i did have fun messing around , wish i used an image instead. Second of all, was the jumping animation. I couldn't figure to use the play animations and decide to scrap the jump and stick with what i know. What i did to compensate was that i used a if/else statment that would make the star appear by using mouseX. I also did this with the background color.</p>
